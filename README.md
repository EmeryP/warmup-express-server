A simple Express server with two routes

## Getting Started
* Fork and clone this repo to your local machine
* Run `npm i` from your cmd line
* In the root directory run `nodemon` from your command line to start the server
* Open `Postman`, send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000`, you can expect `hello` to be returned
* Send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:3000/save` with any JSON object in the body and you can expect the content to be returned to you in JSON format, JSON example is below.

```
{"text": "hello friend"}
```
* Thats it...
